# Installation / Usage ðŸ”§
* Download the file from [here](https://github.com/RustyBalboadev/Discord-Raid-Tool/releases/download/1.1/DiscordRaid.exe)
* Place in a folder that contains a text file named "tokens" this is where you'll be placing all your tokens **make sure each token is seperated by a new line**
# Suggestion
### I would suggest having quite a lot of tokens before raiding, The program works by going through each token and using that token to send a message. You May Get Ratelimited if not!
